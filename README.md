# Spring_Boot_IoT_Data_Monitor

The goal of this project is to develop an IoT data monitoring system using Java Spring Boot.

The purpose of this project is to collect data from a temperature sensor, store it in a database, and present it on a web page.

## Technologies and Tools:
The project utilizes the following technologies and tools:

- Spring Boot
- Arduino
- jSerialComm
- Thymeleaf
- JPA (Java Persistence API)
- MySQL database

To display data in the application, Thymeleaf templates are used, including:

- alldata.html
- dashboard.html
- Humidity.html
- Lastdata.html
- temperature.html

### Getting Started:
To demonstrate the project, open a web browser and visit localhost:8080.

### Configuration:
In the application.properties file, you need to specify the database name, username, and password. In this project, a local database has been used.
